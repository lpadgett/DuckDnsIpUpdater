# DuckDnsIpUpdater
I wrote a script to automatically update your device's IP on [DuckDNS](www.duckdns.org) so you don't have to (:

Just download the script, grant it the proper permissions, run it, and voil√†! The IP for the corresponding domain will be updated periodically in the time interval you specified.



# Use Cases:
I'm really not sure what you want to do with it, but if it involves updating your IP on DuckDNS (the greatest dynamic DNS service there is), then it should do nicely.

As for me, I'm using it to regularly update my IP for my VPN that I'm hosting on my Orange Pi (Armbian setup made easy with Nyr's wonderful [OpenVPN road warrior installer](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install)!). I figure most of you folks would be running Raspbian since Rpis are the most common SBCs around in the maker/hacker space these days, but don't worry, it should work on any Debian derivative (;
